Installation instructions:

1. Install a Remix release from https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/rtx-remix
(Generally, the last release that came out before the build you are installing)

2. Ensure you have the correct artifact.  Most d3d9 games were compiled for x86
computers, and will need the `rtx-remix-for-x86-games-...` package.  If you know
your game was compiled for x64, use the `rtx-remix-for-x64-games-...` package.

3. Copy and paste the files directly into your game directory.

Notes:

- You should be prompted to overwrite existing files - if you aren't, you're
probably putting the files in the wrong place.
